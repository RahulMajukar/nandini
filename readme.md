## Introduction
**Good morning,**

My name is **Nandini Narayan Chikkatumbal**.
I am a **Java Full Stack Developer** currently working at **Swajyot Technology in Bangalore**, with around **one year of hands-on industry experience**. I specialize in developing applications using **Java Spring Boot, React, and PostgreSQL**.

I have completed my **Bachelor of Engineering** from **KLS VDIT, Haliyal**, and my **Diploma** from **Government Polytechnic, Hubli**.

At present, I am working on a project for **AGI Greenpac Ltd**, a company involved in the manufacturing of packaging solutions such as **glass containers**. In this project, we are building a system that handles **multiple digital forms with multi-level approval workflows**. Once all approvals are completed, the system generates the final output as a **PDF**, along with **quality inspection and validation checks** before submission.

Earlier, I worked on the **Gauge FXS project**, which focuses on managing various types of gauges and their **calibration schedules**. The system includes a **calendar-based scheduling feature** and automated **email, SMS, and WhatsApp notifications using twilio service** to alert users about upcoming calibrations.

The application is implemented as a **role-based system** secured using **JWT authentication** and developed using **Java Spring Boot, React, and PostgreSQL**.

Coming to my family background, we are four members in our family—my mother and two younger brothers, who are currently pursuing their studies.

I am presently based in **Bangalore** for professional purposes.

Thank you.
