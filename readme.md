## ✅ Introduction

**Good morning,**

My name is **Nandini Narayan Chikkatumbal**.
I am a **Java Full-Stack Developer** currently working at **Swajyot Technology, Bangalore**, with around **one year of hands-on professional experience**. I specialize in building applications using **Java Spring Boot, React, and PostgreSQL**.

I have completed my **Bachelor of Engineering** from **KLS VDIT, Haliyal**, and my **Diploma** from **Government Polytechnic, Hubli**.

At present, I am working on a project for **AGI Greenpac Ltd**, a company involved in the manufacturing of packaging solutions such as **glass containers**. In this project, we are developing a system that manages **multiple digital forms with multi-level approval workflows**. After all approvals, the system generates the final output as a **PDF document**, along with **quality inspection and validation checks** before submission.

Previously, I worked on the **Gauge FXS project**, which manages different types of gauges and their **calibration schedules**. The system includes a **calendar-based scheduling module** and automated **email, SMS and WhatsApp notifications using the Twilio service** to remind users about upcoming calibrations.

The application is implemented as a **role-based system** secured using **JWT authentication**, and is developed using **Java Spring Boot, React, and PostgreSQL**.

Coming to my family background, we are four members in our family—my mother and two younger brothers, who are currently pursuing their studies.
I am presently based in **Bangalore** for professional purposes.

Thank you.

## ✅ How can computer vision help in yoga guidance?

By detecting **body keypoints and joint angles**, the system can compare the user’s posture with the correct yoga pose and provide feedback for posture correction.

---

## ✅ You are a Java Full-Stack developer. Why this project?

Although my primary experience is in Java full-stack development, I have worked extensively on building **real-time, workflow-based and secure applications**.
I am very interested in applying my software engineering skills to **AI-based healthcare applications**, and this project strongly aligns with that goal, especially in developing reliable systems for **elderly care**.

## ✅ What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is the field of extracting **meaningful information from images and videos** automatically.

---

## ✅ What was the complete pipeline of your face-mask detection project?

Camera or image input
→ face detection using OpenCV
→ cropping the detected face region
→ resizing and preprocessing
→ mask classification using a CNN model
→ displaying the result on the video frame

---

## ✅ Which algorithm or model did you use for classification?

I used a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** implemented using **Keras with the TensorFlow backend** to classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not.

---

## ✅ Why did you use OpenCV in your project?

OpenCV was used for:

* capturing video from the webcam,
* detecting faces in the video frames,
* drawing bounding boxes around faces, and
* displaying real-time results.

---

## ✅ How did you perform face detection?

I used OpenCV’s face-detection approach, such as a **Haar Cascade classifier or a DNN-based face detector**, to detect the face region before passing it to the mask-classification model.

---

## ✅ What is the role of CNN in your project?

The CNN automatically extracts spatial features such as **edges, textures and facial patterns** and learns to distinguish between **masked and unmasked faces**.

---

## ✅ How is this project related to AI-guided yoga?

Both projects use **computer vision on live video streams**.
Just as face detection and mask classification analyze facial regions, AI-guided yoga relies on **detecting body keypoints and analyzing posture** from camera input.
The overall processing pipeline and real-time constraints are very similar.

---

## ✅ What is the difference between image processing and computer vision in your project?

Image processing mainly focuses on operations such as **resizing, normalization and filtering**,
whereas computer vision focuses on **understanding the content of the image**, such as detecting faces and classifying whether a mask is present.

---

## ✅ Why did you choose TensorFlow and Keras?

Keras provides a **simple and high-level API** for building and training deep-learning models, while TensorFlow offers an **efficient and scalable backend** for training and inference.

---

## ✅ Can your model run in real time?

Yes, the system was designed to run in **near real time** on a normal laptop webcam using OpenCV and a lightweight CNN model.
