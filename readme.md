## Interview Questions
### ✅ Introduction
**Good morning,**

My name is **Nandini Narayan Chikkatumbal**.
I am a **Java Full Stack Developer** currently working at **Swajyot Technology in Bangalore**, with around **one year of hands-on industry experience**. I specialize in developing applications using **Java Spring Boot, React, and PostgreSQL**.
I have completed my **Bachelor of Engineering** from **KLS VDIT, Haliyal**, and my **Diploma** from **Government Polytechnic, Hubli**.
At present, I am working on a project for **AGI Greenpac Ltd**, a company involved in the manufacturing of packaging solutions such as **glass containers**. In this project, we are building a system that handles **multiple digital forms with multi-level approval workflows**. Once all approvals are completed, the system generates the final output as a **PDF**, along with **quality inspection and validation checks** before submission.
Earlier, I worked on the **Gauge FXS project**, which focuses on managing various types of gauges and their **calibration schedules**. The system includes a **calendar-based scheduling feature** and automated **email, SMS, and WhatsApp notifications using twilio service** to alert users about upcoming calibrations.
The application is implemented as a **role-based system** secured using **JWT authentication** and developed using **Java Spring Boot, React, and PostgreSQL**.
Coming to my family background, we are four members in our family—my mother and two younger brothers, who are currently pursuing their studies.
I am presently based in **Bangalore** for professional purposes.
Thank you.


### ✅ How can computer vision help in yoga guidance?
By detecting body keypoints and joint angles, the system can compare the user’s posture with the correct pose and give feedback for correction.

### You are a Java Full Stack developer. Why this project?
Although my primary experience is in Java full-stack development, I have worked extensively on building real-time, workflow-based systems and secure applications.
I am very interested in applying my software engineering skills to AI-based healthcare applications, and this project strongly aligns with that goal, especially in building reliable systems for elderly care.

### What is Computer Vision?
→ extracting meaningful information from images / videos


### ✅ What was the complete pipeline of your project?
Camera / image input
→ face detection using OpenCV
→ cropping the face region
→ resizing and preprocessing
→ mask classification using a CNN model
→ displaying the result on the video frame

### ✅ Which algorithm or model did you use for classification?
I used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend for classifying whether a person is wearing a mask or not.

### ✅ Why did you use OpenCV in your project?
OpenCV was used for:
capturing video from the webcam
detecting faces in the frame
drawing bounding boxes
displaying real-time results
